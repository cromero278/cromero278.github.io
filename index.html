		<h2>Whole Brain Paragraph</h2>
		<p>A recent time that I had to use my whole brain, both the technical and creative/emotional was when
		I recently competed in my first Olympic weightlifting meet. This is a highly technical sport and is involves
		two movements, they are called the snatch and the clean and jerk. One of the most important facets of the sport
		is having technically sound form, as that's the most efficient way to lift a barbell. However, there is also
		a passionate and creative side in showing up every day for long training sessions and collaborating with coaches
		and teammates on accessory practices and mental aspects that help shape you as a better athlete. Sometimes if
		certain coaching techniques are not processing it takes some creativity and body awareness to be able to verbalize
		to others what is not working. Additionally, there is a mental in that you must set aside the emotions of
		having a bad day or seeing a teammate have a better training day than you, etc. and continue to perform. I believe
		a lot of struggle and work in this sport can translate into whole brain thinking and even help in professional aspects
		of life.

		<h2>Visuals speak</h2>
		For this exercise I chose my first photo as a long road where seemingly, you cannot yet see exactly where it leads. This accurately
		depicts my current career, as I'm on the road to completing this bootcamp, but am not yet sure exactly where it will lead. I know that
		I will be returning to my job but I'm not sure what my new roll will entail or how long I will stay in my current role. 
		As for the future I chose a photo of two people exchanging business cards. Eventually I would like to be my own boss and perhaps 
		freelance web development and digital media. The end goal would be the ability to work from home or have my own office, while also
		caring for my family.

		<h2>TEAM</h2>
		
		<p>This week we played an awesome game, called Forbidden Island. In playing this I definitely recognize that I am generally
		a leader in a group setting which I had aside in this game (as well as in capstone) because firstly I didn't
		know how to play the game and one of my teammates was very well versed in the game, and also because the game is definitely won
		only when you listen and collaborate with your team. What I think I've learned from the group activity, is
		as far as communication goes, I don't generally have a problem speaking but I am trying to be better about listening and 
		allowing our more softspoken teammates to communicate and collaborate.

		<h2>Trails Ground Rules</h2>
		Respect others.<br><br>

		Everyone is responsible for the ground rules.<br><br>

		If something comes up like an emergency or going to miss a dead line? Please let your team know.<br><br>

		We will vote on big decisions using Slack group chat.<br><br>

		Communicate on Slack or text.<br><br>

		If someone is not doing there part or work. The team will meet to have a conversation about whatâ€™s happening. Next step they will be turned into George for further action.<br><br>

		All work done needs to be finalized by the hole team before summiting it.<br><br>

		Try to turn in work a day before the due date.<br><br>

		Set up a meet once every other week and if there is an emergency.<br><br>

		Any changes to the ground rules needs to be okayed by the whole team.<br><br>

		<h2>Weekly Reflection 1/19/19</h2>
		<p> Last week we had the opportinity to attend the monthly Tech Update. A woman from NM Tech hire spoke about their program, 
		which I was not previously aware of. It is a grant-funded program that aims to build tech opportunities in Albuquerque. We also 
		heard from an engineer at Aviata, a company also based out of ABQ. I'll admit his lecture was somewhat intimidating, as I wasn't
		familiar with some of the jargon and terminology he was using when talking about their current projects, however I hope to get 
		more familiar with these things and hopefully attend more tech events in the future. </p>
		
		<h2>Weekly Reflection 1/26/19</h2>
		<p>As the second week of the cohort comes to a close I definitely feel more confident in my ability and also less intimdated in attending
		events. This week we had data design and object oriented assignments, which for whatever reason were easier and more enjoyable for me than
		some javascript stuff we've done previously. The object oriented assignment was the first time I've had to really problem solve in an assignment
		which was challenging and frustrating but also fulfilling once the code finally ran. Additionally, we had the opportunity to attend an event at UNM, 
		which showed the light at the end of the tunnel in a way, as I was able to see previous cohorts showing off their work and how far their project has come.
		All in all week two gave me more confidence, and I am excited for the challenges in weeks to come.</p>
		
		<h2>Weekly Reflection 2/1/2019</h2>
		<p>This week was long and eventful. We were placed into our capstone teams mid-week and I was happy to be working on my first
		choice, ABQ Trails (name pending). I'm excited but also nervous for this project, I think we have a lot of really great ideas
		but actually getting them to come to fruition will be telling. I am super happy with my team members, I think we all bring
		different strengths to the table and I'm excited to see what we can come up with as a team creatively and technically. 
		Other than capstone the week was pretty standard, I'm still struggling a little with javascript functions, so I'm working
		in my free time to try and improve in that area. Friday was super fun as we heard from a few presenters about tech and art, 
		my favorite was probably Nick's presentation, and I was also very impressed and personally intersted in Britney's work. All in
		all it was a good week and I'm ready to come back rested Monday and do it all over again. </p>
		
		<h2>Weekly Reflection 2/8/2019</h2>
		<p>We're almost half way through the bootcamp! This week was super busy but fun. We were able to really dive into capstone
		this week, we created our mySQL insert statements and classes. Thursday, we essentially coded for capstone all day and after
		8 hours of work it was surreal to look up and realize I had written about 500 lines of code. Javascript functions are still
		challenging for me, but I feel like I'm making some progress. I really liked the bootstrap challenge, it was slow to start 
		but once I got the hang of it I really enjoyed it. I think UI/UX is definitely my thing, although surprisingly I also am 
		enjoying mySQL. Additionally I had a great time and lunch and learn on Friday, all three speakers were not only inspriring
		but so energetic and made me really excited about the field I'm entering. It definitely gave me a bit of fire to work harder
		the upcoming weeks. </p>
