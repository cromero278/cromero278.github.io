		<h2>Whole Brain Paragraph</h2>
		<p>A recent time that I had to use my whole brain, both the technical and creative/emotional was when
		I recently competed in my first Olympic weightlifting meet. This is a highly technical sport and is involves
		two movements, they are called the snatch and the clean and jerk. One of the most important facets of the sport
		is having technically sound form, as that's the most efficient way to lift a barbell. However, there is also
		a passionate and creative side in showing up every day for long training sessions and collaborating with coaches
		and teammates on accessory practices and mental aspects that help shape you as a better athlete. Sometimes if
		certain coaching techniques are not processing it takes some creativity and body awareness to be able to verbalize
		to others what is not working. Additionally, there is a mental in that you must set aside the emotions of
		having a bad day or seeing a teammate have a better training day than you, etc. and continue to perform. I believe
		a lot of struggle and work in this sport can translate into whole brain thinking and even help in professional aspects
		of life.
